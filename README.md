# GDSCA 2022 Figures

These figures were used in the [`2022 Global Deep-Sea Capacity Assessment`](https://deepseacapacity.oceandiscoveryleague.org/). They were generated by the [`gdsca-2022-notebook`](https://github.com/ocean-discovery-league/gdsca-2022-notebook). This repo contains many additional figures that did not appear in the assessment report. Please see the data page for more information, and for links to a public copy of the [`data used in the assessment`](https://github.com/ocean-discovery-league/gdsca-2022-data) and the [`Python Jupyter notebook`](https://github.com/ocean-discovery-league/gdsca-2022-notebook) used to create them.

This repo also has copies of the [`gdsca-2022-notebook`](https://github.com/ocean-discovery-league/gdsca-2022-notebook) run across all eight regions of the study with output saved inline for reference. This are found in the [`notebooks directory`](https://github.com/ocean-discovery-league/gdsca-2022-figures/tree/main/notebooks).

Note: The copies of the reference notebooks in this repo do not have the correct figures for section 2, but correct copies of those figures are available in the separate images files.
