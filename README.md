# GDSCA 2022 Figures

These figures were used in the [`2022 Global Deep-Sea Capacity Assessment`](https://deepseacapacity.oceandiscoveryleague.org/). They were generated by the [`gdsca-2022-notebook`](https://github.com/ocean-discovery-league/gdsca-2022-notebook). This repo contains many additional figures that did not appear in the assessment report.

This repo also has copies of the [`gdsca-2022-notebook`](https://github.com/ocean-discovery-league/gdsca-2022-notebook) run across all eight regions of the study with output saved inline for reference.

Note: The copies of the reference notebooks will not have the correct figures for section 2, but correct copies of those figures are available as separate images files in this repo.
